# Week-1-Tree_Species_Identification
ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§ This repository will house a tree species identification project I'm developing during my internship at Edunet Foundation. The aim is to create a tool that can recognize different tree species using observable traits like leaf shape, bark texture, and more. Stay tuned as I branch out into the world of plant classification!
