# Tree Species Identification Project

## Overview

This repository contains the initial framework for a Tree Species Identification project developed as part of my internship at **Edunet Foundation**. The primary objective of this project is to explore and implement methods for identifying tree species based on observable characteristics such as leaf shape, bark texture, and other morphological features.

## Objectives

- To collect and analyze data related to various tree species.
- To develop a classification system for identifying tree species.
- To leverage technology in promoting environmental awareness and biodiversity studies.

## Status

This project is currently in the early development phase. Further updates will include data collection methods, classification logic, and implementation details.

## Technologies (Planned)

- Python
- Machine Learning (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Image Processing (e.g., OpenCV)
- Google Colab for prototyping and analysis
